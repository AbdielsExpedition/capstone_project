While writing this introduction, 6100 flights are scheduled in the next 7 days from Istanbul to 111 different countries according to flightradar24.com. People who are scheduling their vacations are surfing from one travel blog to another in order to find information about the destinations. Therefore, I decided to make my Applied Data Science Capstone Project on the comparison of two cities with respect to their neighbourhood features and average accommodation prices. This starter-level project aims to target two kind of people. The first one is the people who are planning their travel and looking for an accommodation in a neighbourhood they expect and the second one is the people who decided to move abroad and looking for a long-term accommodation that matches with their hometowns. In that manner, this project contains the comparison of Istanbul and Toronto by using Foursquare and Airbnb data.\n\nHope you enjoy! \n"

ArcGIS library is used in order to get the geospatial data of Istanbul's neighbourhoods (geocoding).\n   5. The most common venues and related information are obtained from Foursquare API for both cities. Foursquare data are used for the neighbourhood clustering and shown on the city maps (folium map). \n   6. Average accommodation prices of neighbourhoods are calculated by using Inside Airbnb website which shares location and daily rent data. Choropleth maps are created by the average daily rent prices of the neigbourhoods.\n   7.

The venues' common categories were obtained from Foursquare API and clustered by using K-Means Clustering. The number of clusters (K) was determined by using the elbow Method. The first discussion point is that the elbow method graph did not give a clear K number. Generally, elbow method graphs show a sharp difference between two neighbouring points and the optimal K number is chosen according to this sharp slope reduction. However, my graph does not have a clear sharp slope reduction between two neighbouring points and then I chose a relatively appropriate point. As a result, the fifth cluster has only one sample because of the number of clusters. Moreover, other methods like Silhouette or Gap Statistics methods for determining K number can be used. Another discussion point is that most of the neighbourhoods in Toronto placed in cluster 1, which means differentiation among them was not performed well. Clustering neighbourhoods with their venues was a good idea, but at the end, it can be clearly seen it is not sufficient for this analysis. More parameters can be found and added to diversify the neighbourhoods.\n\nThe average daily rent prices were obtained from Inside Airbnb datasets and they were used to point relatively expensive neighbourhoods. I am not familiar with the neighbourhoods in Toronto, but for Istanbul, some results are kind of misleading. House sale or annually rent prices can be also included for a better analysis. \n\nAs a result, this analysis suggests that if you are living in Caddebostan or Suadiye(cluster 1) in Istanbul, you might not feel stranger in Thorncliffe Park or Caledonia-Fairbanks(cluster 1) in Toronto in terms of venues and daily rent expensiveness. or vice versa.\n"
